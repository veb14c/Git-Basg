My idea for this semester is to create an interactive webpage, that allows two types of users to create timers that countdown to a specified date.
It would so this by subtracting the date entered in by the user from the current date, displaying the difference in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
This web application will incorporate three types of users; administrator, anonymous user, and logged in user.
